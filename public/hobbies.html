        <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
        <hr />
        <h2>Computer Hardware</h2>
        <p>
            Driven by an unwavering passion for computers, I marveled at their
            limitless potential from a young age. Linus Tech Tips, a notable
            YouTuber, fueled my curiosity, inspiring me to stay abreast of
            cutting-edge computer hardware. Today, I eagerly share my expertise,
            aiding others in fixing and building their machines, grateful for
            the ever-evolving world of technology.
        </p>
        <h2>Gaming</h2>
        <p>
            Playing video games allows me to relieve tension and unwind after a
            long day of school or job. I'm referring to competitive gaming. What
            could be better than people from all over the world congregating in
            one place, being cheered on and applauded by millions of other
            gamers?
        </p>
        <h2>Swimming</h2>
        <p>
            As a child, my father's regular trips to the swimming pool ignited a
            lifelong love for the water. Learning to swim at a tender age, I
            honed my skills and excelled in the sport over time. Embracing the
            thrill of competitions, I emerged victorious in several, cherishing
            the memories of those triumphant moments. I still continue to swim,
            not competitively but as a fitness hobby.
        </p>
        <h2>Cooking</h2>
        <p>
            Recently, I've found a newfound joy in cooking. Preparing delectable
            dishes for my loved ones, and relishing them myself, has become a
            cherished pastime. Cooking with friends adds to the fun, crafting
            delightful meals to savor while enjoying a movie together, creating
            moments of pure delight and togetherness.
        </p>
        <h2>Dancing</h2>
        <p>
            While I may not be the best dancer, my passion drives me to improve
            continuously. I embrace the rhythm, learning moves for specific
            songs and letting the music guide me. As a child, I hesitated to
            dance, fearing judgment. I'm now an active dancer, dancing without a
            care in the world and having a good time with friends and family.
        </p>
        <h2>Eight-Ball</h2>
        <p>
            A few years ago, we stumbled upon a pool table, intrigued but
            clueless. With curiosity as our guide, we attempted to play. Soon,
            we played regularly, though I felt like a liability. Determined, I
            embarked on a training journey, practicing relentlessly. Two weeks
            later, I emerged a force to reckon with, dominating the game with
            newfound skill and confidence. Now, I play the game as a leisure
            activity. As an activity to unwind after a long day with a chilled
            beverage.
        </p>
        <h2>Video Editing</h2>
        <p>
            My own favorite activity has always been video editing. I enjoy
            making hilarious YouTube videos. I also work as a video editor for
            other YouTube channels. Video editing allows me to express myself
            creatively.
